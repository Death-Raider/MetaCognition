Prompt:
Before diving into whether 49 is a prime number, let's break down the process of determining if any number is prime. Here’s how you can approach this:

1. **Understand Prime Numbers**: Start by defining what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Check for Divisibility by 2**: Since 49 is odd (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step. For even numbers, checking divisibility by 2 would be sufficient to determine they are not prime.

3. **Check for Divisibility by Other Numbers**: Now, test if 49 can be divided evenly by any number between 3 and the square root of 49. The reason we only need to check up to the square root is because if there were a factor larger than the square root, its corresponding factor would have to be smaller than the square root, making it already checked.

Prompt: '

Is 49 a prime number? Let's explore this question by breaking it down into steps and contrasting it with other numbers to understand why 49 behaves differently.

Step 1: Definition of Prime Numbers
Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.

Step 2: Identifying Factors of 49
Now, let's find the factors of 49. A factor is a number that divides another number without leaving a remainder. For example, 2 is a factor of 6 because 6 divided by 2 equals 3 with no remainder.

Step 3: Comparing 49 to Other Numbers
Consider the number 5, which is a prime number. It has only two factors: 1 and 5. Now, compare this to 49.

Step 4: Finding Common Factors
When we look for factors of 49, we discover more than just 1 and 49. Can you identify any other factors?

Prompt: ' List the steps you would take to determine if 49 is a prime number and explain your reasoning for each step.
Step 1: Check if the number is less than 2
Reasoning: Prime numbers are defined as positive integers greater than 1 that have no positive integer divisors other than 1 and themselves. Since 49 is greater than 2, we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Check if the number is divisible by 2
Reasoning: If a number is divisible by 2, it cannot be a prime number since it would have at least three divisors: 1, 2, and itself. Since 49 is not divisible by 2, we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by any odd number up to its square root
Reasoning: For any given number, if it is not divisible by 2, then it can only be divisible by odd numbers. The largest possible factor of a number is its square root, so we only need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 49. The square root of 49 is 7, which is an odd number.

Prompt: ' Step 1: Understand that prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Step 2: Check if 49 is greater than 1. Since it is (49 > 1), proceed to the next step.

Step 3: Determine if 49 has any divisors other than 1 and itself. Begin by checking divisibility by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

Step 4: Since 49 is not divisible by 2 (49 ÷ 2 ≠ whole number), move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

Step 5: Check if 49 is divisible by 3 (49 ÷ 3 ≠ whole number). As it's not divisible, continue with the next prime number.

Step 6: The next prime number is 5. Since 49 is not divisible by 5 (49 ÷ 5 ≠ whole number), proceed to the next prime number, which is 7.

Step 7: Divide 49 by 7 (49 ÷ 7 = 7). Since this results in a whole number, we have found a divisor of 49 other'

Prompt: ' List of steps:

1. Understand that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Check if 49 is greater than 1. It is, as it equals 7 squared (7*7).
3. Determine if 49 has any divisors other than 1 and itself. In this case, it can be divided by 7 (49 = 7*7).
4. Since 49 has a divisor other than 1 and itself (which is 7), it is not a prime number.

Answer: 49 is not a prime number because it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself, specifically by 7.'
