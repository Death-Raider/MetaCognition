Strategy - Stepwise Procedural Guide
Instruct Prompt - Using '{strategy}', create a prompt that helps a low-skill agent work through the problem in steps. Do not provide the solution or anything except the prompt itself.
Generated Prompt -  1. Identify the potential hazard: Recognize that touching an electrical socket with wet hands increases the risk of electric shock, which can lead to serious injury or even death.

2. Understand the principle: Wet hands conduct electricity better than dry hands, making it easier for current to flow through your body when you come into contact with an electrical outlet.

3. Assess personal vulnerability: Consider that your wet skin might have more moisture and smaller pores, which can enhance conductivity and increase the likelihood of an electric shock.

4. Reflect on consequences: Realize that electric shocks from wet hands can result in severe burns, cardiac arrest, or other life-threatening conditions, especially if the current is high.

5. Evaluate alternatives: Think about using dry hands or a dry object (like a towel) to safely interact with electrical outlets until your hands are dry.

6. Learn proper safety measures: Educate yourself on electrical safety rules and guidelines, such as always ensuring that your hands are dry before handling electrical devices or outlets.

7. Seek professional advice: If you're unsure about the risks involved, consult an electrician or a qualified professional who can provide guidance on safe practices around electrical equipment and installations.

Generated Prompt -  Use the Define, List, and Exemplify method to analyze this scenario.
Prompt:
Step 1: Define the scenario - In this situation, we have ice cubes left outside in direct sunlight.

Step 2: List the potential outcomes - As the ice cubes are exposed to the sun, they can undergo several changes:

a) Melting: The heat from the sun causes the ice to absorb warmth, which turns it into water.

b) Evaporation: Some of the water might also turn into vapor as it absorbs more heat.

c) Temperature increase: The temperature around the ice cubes could rise, affecting any nearby objects.

d) Potential melting of other substances: If there are any items in close proximity, they might also start to warm up due to the heat absorbed by the ice cubes.

Step 3: Exemplify each outcome - Let's consider an example for each possible result:

a) Melting: Imagine you have a glass filled with ice-cold lemonade. After leaving it outside in the sun for 10 minutes, you return to find the ice cubes have melted completely, and the lemonade is now warm.

b) Evaporation: Picture a wet towel laid out in the sun. Over time, the towel might become dry

Prompt:

To determine what happens to ice cubes left out in the sun for 10 minutes, let's use the "enumerate assistance methods" technique:

1. **Identify the situation**: Ice cubes are placed outside under direct sunlight.
2. **List possible outcomes** based on common knowledge:
   - A) They will melt completely
   - B) They will partially melt
   - C) They will stay solid
   - D) They will freeze and become harder
3. **Eliminate unlikely options**:
   - D) is unlikely since ice cannot freeze in warmth.
4. **Consider factors** affecting the melting process:
   - Sunlight intensity
   - Ambient temperature
   - Ice cube size
5. **Predict outcome** based on these factors:
   - Given typical summer conditions, ice cubes would most likely:
   - **Option B) Partially melt**

Query - You have 3 red balls and 2 blue balls in a bag. If you take two balls without looking, what is the probability they are both red?

If you include anything other than the prompt, or if the prompt contains the answer, your response will be considered invalid and rejected.
Generated Prompt -  Provide a step-by-step guide for the agent to calculate this probability.

1. First, determine the total number of balls in the bag.
   - Count the number of red balls (3) and blue balls (2).
   - Add them together: 3 + 2 = 5 balls in total.

2. Calculate the probability of drawing one red ball first.
   - There are 3 red balls out of 5 total balls.
   - Probability of drawing one red ball = Number of red balls / Total number of balls = 3/5.

3. Calculate the probability of drawing another red ball after the first one has been drawn.
   - After drawing one red ball, there are now 2 red balls left and 4 balls in total.
   - Probability of drawing another red ball = Number of remaining red balls / Total number of remaining balls = 2/4.

4. Multiply the probabilities from steps 2 and 3 to find the overall probability of drawing two red balls in a row.
   - Overall probability = Probability of drawing one red ball * Probability of drawing another red ball = (3/5) * (2/4).

5. Simplify the result to get the final probability.

Generated Prompt -  Start by identifying the type of object described in the riddle.
Prompt: Hello! You're facing a riddle challenge today. The task is to identify the type of object described in the following riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alivewith wind." To start, let's break down the riddle into smaller parts. First, focus on the action verbs used in the riddle. Can you spot any? These verbs often give clues about what the object might do or interact with. For example, "speak" suggests communication, while "hear" implies receiving information. Remember, the object doesn't have a mouth or ears, so think about alternative ways it could perform these actions. Next, consider the characteristics mentioned in the riddle. The absence of a body hints at something intangible. The phrase "come alive with wind" suggests that the object interacts with air movement. Now, try combining these insights to form a hypothesis about the object being described. Think about common objects that could fulfill these roles and how they might relate to the given clues. Finally, take a moment to reflect on your hypothesis. Does it make sense based on the information provided? Keep in mind that the goal is not

Strategy - Stepwise Procedural Guide
Instruct Prompt - Using '{strategy}', create a prompt that helps a low-skill agent work through the problem in steps. Do not provide the solution or anything except the prompt itself.
Generated Prompt -  Please use the following stepwise procedural guide to help you solve this problem:

1. Identify the total number of balls in the bag.
2. Determine the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the total.
3. Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 red balls out of the 3 available.
4. Calculate the probability of choosing 2 red balls by dividing the number of ways to choose 2 red balls by the total number of ways to choose 2 balls.
5. Write down your final answer as a fraction or decimal. To solve this problem using the stepwise procedural guide, follow these steps:

1. The total number of balls in the bag is 3 red + 2 blue = 5 balls.

2. To determine the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the total, we can use combinations. The formula for combinations is: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 5 (total balls) and r = 2 (balls chosen). So, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)

Instruct Prompt - Using '{strategy}', create a prompt that helps a low-skill agent work through the problem in steps. Do not provide the solution or anything except the prompt itself.
Generated Prompt -  To solve this problem, follow these steps:

  1. Define: Identify the total number of balls in the bag and the number of each color.
    * Total balls = 3 red + 2 blue = 5 balls
    * Red balls = 3
    * Blue balls = 2

    * BR (blue-red)
    * BB (blue-blue)
  3. Exemplify: Use the combinations to calculate the probability of getting two red balls.
    * Probability of RR = Number of ways to get RR / Total number of ways to pick 2 balls
    * Probability of RR = (Number of ways to choose 2 red balls) / (Total number of ways to choose 2 balls)
    * Probability of RR = (3 choose 2) / (5 choose 2)
