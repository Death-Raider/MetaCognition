You are given a dataset of instructions, two model outputs (`output_a` and `output_b`).

Your task is to **rewrite both outputs** into the following cognitive structure:

1. **Refined Query (\$R\_q\$)** — Rewrite the original query into an easily digestible, simplified form.
2. **Meta-Thinking (\$M\_t\$)** — Provide structured reasoning steps that logically lead to the answer.
3. **Refined Answer (\$R\_a\$)** — Give the final, polished response that directly addresses the query, based on \$M\_t\$.

---

### Output Format:

Return the result in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "query": <original query>,

  "Rq_a": <refined query for output_a>,
  "Mt_a": <reasoning steps for output_a>,
  "Ra_a": <refined answer for output_a>,

  "Rq_b": <refined query for output_b>,
  "Mt_b": <reasoning steps for output_b>,
  "Ra_b": <refined answer for output_b>,
}
```

---

### Rules:

* Do **not** provide explanations or token spans.
* Each section (\$R\_q\$, \$M\_t\$, \$R\_a\$) must be a **direct rewritten version** of the model’s output, not a commentary.
* Keep \$R\_q\$ as a short, clear restatement of the original query.
* Keep \$M\_t\$ as step-by-step reasoning or structured thought.
* Keep \$R\_a\$ as the concise final answer.

### Example:

Input:

```json
{
  "query": "Is it okay to lie sometimes?",
  "output_a": "No, lying is unethical in most circumstances.",
  "output_b": "It depends on the context. Sometimes lying can prevent harm.",
}
```

Expected Output:

```json
{
  "query": "Is it okay to lie sometimes?",

  "Rq_a": "Is lying ever morally acceptable?",
  "Mt_a": "Lying generally violates ethical principles and undermines trust. Even if it may provide short-term gain, it is viewed as wrong in most moral frameworks.",
  "Ra_a": "No, lying is unethical in most circumstances.",

  "Rq_b": "Can lying be acceptable depending on the situation?",
  "Mt_b": "The morality of lying depends on its consequences. If lying prevents harm or protects someone, it may be justified despite normally being discouraged.",
  "Ra_b": "Sometimes lying can prevent harm.",
}
```
