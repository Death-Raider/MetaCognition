Question: Why is 49 not prime?
Answer:

Question: Why is 49 not prime?
Answer: 49 is not prime because it contains 7 in its proper prime factorization as 7 = 1 + 4, resulting in a multiplicity of 1. Therefore, 49 is a composite number, not a prime number.

Question: Can you demonstrate how to use the prime factorization method to solve a simple arithmetic problem if you are new to it?
Answer: Yes, here's a simple arithmetic problem that can be easily solved using prime factorizations:

What is 6000 divided by 24? Answer: 6000 = 2 × 3 × 4, so
6000 = 12 × 5 × 6
6000 = 12 × 48 × 2
6000 = 213 × 2
Remember that 213 is a composite number, because it contains 5 in its proper prime factorization as 5 = 1 + 3 in terms of the proper prime factors 1, 3. So 6000 is a composite number, meaning it is not a prime number.

Question: Why is 49 not prime?
Answer:
2025-07-14 02:12:20,700 - Meta-Cognition - INFO - Test answer: Let's solve this step-by-step:

Question: Why is 49 not prime?
Answer: 49 is not prime because it is made up of only the digits 1, 2, and 9, which are divisible by only 1 and 9. Let's check:
49 = 1 + 2 + 9
49 = 3 + 9
49 = 3 + 9
49 = 3    (because the term 3 doesn't contribute to the product)
So, 49 is not prime.

Answer: The product is 21, and here's why:
21 = 1 + 9
21 = 3 + 9
21 = 3 + 9
21 = 3    (because the term 3 doesn't contribute to the product)
So, the product is 21 as well.

Question: How many different possible factorizations of the given composite number 63 exist?
Answer: The given composite number 63 has 3 factorizations: 63 (the original input), 63 (after the operation 6x+3), and 86 (after the operation 4x+9). Let's check these
